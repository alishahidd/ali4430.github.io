Gartner insights into Enterprise perspective on Microservices<br>
  <p>

    <p>
Microservices are application components that are independent and specific in regards to the task they handle.<br>
They can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks in an application but are mostly used to implement features within a back-end service.<br>
      <p>

        <p>
Microservices are not for everyone. Organizations with large legacy code bases may not benefit as there is already much at play within their systems. <br>
If something goes wrong it may be difficult to pinpoint how and why. Theyre beneficial as they can be scaled independently leading to cost and performance benefits in the long term.<br> 
This will allow organizations with continuous development practices to release features as such. <br>
In the short term, lots of time and resources may be required to get all the necessary microservices off the ground. <br>
          <p>

A good example of this would be notifications on Twitter. There is a specific microservice that tells the user when they get a direct message <br>
from someone. Maybe a different microservice in charge of sending users a notification if someone liked their tweet. <br>
As a company gains more users over time the respective microservices can be scaled to handle more traffic. <br>
Additional microservices can also be created to implement new features. <br>
